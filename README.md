Original Game Background:
Spy Hunter is a vertical scrolling driving game with the player in the role of a spy driving an armed sportscar. The object of the game is to travel the freeway destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible while protecting civilian vehicles. The game uses a top-down perspective.

The game begins with the player driving the fictitious G-6155 Interceptor. Various enemy vehicles try to destroy the player's car or to force it off the road, including a helicopter that drops bombs from overhead. A counter increments the score while the car is moving and on the road. Additional points are earned destroying enemy vehicles using weapons or by forcing them off the road. After an initial lead-in time during which the player has an unlimited supply of cars, the player must earn extra cars by obtaining sufficient points. Destroying non-enemy cars halts the score counter for a short while, and no points are scored whenever the player's car is off the road. The car can be destroyed by a hard collision with another vehicle, if it is hit by an enemy weapon (including the craters blasted into the road by the helicopter's bombs), or by running far enough off the roadway (or waterway).

Following periodic forks in the road, players can enter new regions with different terrain or weather conditions. Players can also augment the car's standard machine guns with other weapons by entering the weapons van, which appears in each new territory and can be periodically summoned by pressing the blinking "Weapons Van" button. Three special weapons are available: oil slicks, smoke screens, and surface-to-air missiles. Each has limited ammo and are lost if the player's car is destroyed. The game's dashboard shows which weapons are available, when lit.

It is possible for the player to convert the car into a go-fast boat for brief periods by driving through a special boathouse which appears infrequently at the side of the road after which the player is attacked by two different enemy boats.

The in-game road is endless and the game itself has no ending despite the mythical graveyard ending that some players claimed to have existed.

Game designer George Gomez drew inspiration for the game from listening to an audio cassette tape of music from James Bond films. He designed the game with Tom Leon, with whom he had worked on TRON. Gomez sketched out the in-game road map on a long scroll of drawing paper and also came up with the idea of the weapons van. Originally the game was to be based directly on James Bond and have the James Bond theme as in-game music, but the license could not be acquired. Instead, an electronic arrangement of Henry Mancini's theme to Peter Gunn plays throughout.

Minimum Viable Product:
1. Your G-6155 Interceptor spy-mobile with machine gun that fires from bottom to top of the screen.
2. Enemy Cars: Standard Blue Cars and the "Switchblade" which will gain you points if you destroy. The latter has collision damage from the left and right as well due to tire slashers
3. Friendly civilion vehicle obstacles: red cars and motorcycles (faster/smaller) which will slow you down, cause minor damage to you and you will not gain points for a number of seconds.
4. Top-down and top-to-bottm scrolling landscape/road that occasionally narrows and then widens again
5. Award points for enemy cars destroyed and award "extra lives/cars" at certain point thresholds.
6. Allow for 2nd player to take a turn for high score.

Extras:
1. Other Weapons (from weapon re-supply truck): Oil Slick, Smoke Screen, and Missiles.
2. Other Enemies: There are five different enemies in the road sequence: tire slashers called "Switchblade" armored cars called "Bulletproof Bully", and limousines called "Double Barrel Action" and helicopters called "Master Of The Sky".
3. Boat hovercraft mode and possibly urban legend graveyard final landscape sequence.
4. 2-Player on same screen mode
5. High Score Leaderboard
4. Additional skins, perhaps one for Blade Runner or The Fifth Element or another one I am considering related to RiNo area construction and the rise of Lime/Lyft/Uber scooters and those who ride them (myself included).
